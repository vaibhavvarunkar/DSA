# Also know as "SINKING SORT".

# It is a simple sorting algorithm which sorts n number of
# elements in the list by comparing the each pair of adjacent
# items and swaps them if they are in wrong order.

# Bubble Sort is an easy-to-implement,
# stable sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(nÂ²) in the
################         average and worst cases â€“ and O(n) in the best case.       #################################
